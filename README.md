# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project: Online Retail Dataset

## Project Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Online Retail dataset to extract meaningful insights and patterns. The dataset contains transactional data from a UK-based online retail store, spanning from December 1, 2010, to December 9, 2011. The goal is to analyze customer purchasing behavior, identify sales trends, and uncover insights for better decision-making.
